        <h1>Incident Management Policy Template</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This Incident Management Policy outlines the procedures for effectively managing security incidents within the organization. The goal is to ensure that incidents are detected promptly, reported, and responded to in a structured and efficient manner to minimize impact and prevent recurrence. This policy defines the roles and responsibilities involved in incident management and provides a framework for incident response, recovery, and post-incident analysis.</p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party users who may be involved in the detection, reporting, or management of security incidents. It covers incidents related to information security breaches, system failures, and other events that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the organization's information systems and data. The policy includes guidelines for incident reporting, response procedures, and communication protocols.</p>

        <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Users:</strong> Users are required to report any suspected or actual security incidents immediately to the designated incident response team. They must cooperate with the response efforts and follow instructions to mitigate the impact of the incident.</li>
            <li><strong>Managers:</strong> Managers must ensure that their teams are aware of and adhere to incident management procedures. They are responsible for supporting incident response efforts within their departments and facilitating communication between the incident response team and affected parties.</li>
            <li><strong>IT Department:</strong> The IT department is responsible for overseeing the incident management process, coordinating the response, and maintaining incident records. They must ensure that appropriate incident response mechanisms are in place, conduct regular training, and perform post-incident reviews to improve future response efforts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Policy Statements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All security incidents must be reported immediately through the established reporting channels to ensure prompt response and containment.</li>
            <li>The incident response process must include steps for incident identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and communication to manage the incident effectively and minimize impact.</li>
            <li>Post-incident reviews must be conducted to analyze the root cause of the incident, evaluate the effectiveness of the response, and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence.</li>
            <li>Incident response procedures must be regularly reviewed and updated to address emerging threats and improve response capabilities.</li>
            <li>Confidentiality of incident details must be maintained to protect sensitive information and prevent unnecessary alarm or disclosure.</li>
        </ul>
