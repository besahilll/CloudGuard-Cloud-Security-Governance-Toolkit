            <h1>Access Control Policy</h1>
            <div class="section-content">
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This policy establishes comprehensive requirements for managing and controlling access to the organization’s information and information systems. Its primary goal is to ensure that access is granted only to authorized individuals and that sensitive and critical information remains secure from unauthorized access. By defining clear access control measures, the policy aims to protect the organization’s data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.</p>
                
                <h2>Scope</h2>
                <p>The Access Control Policy applies to all individuals who interact with the organization's information systems and data, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Employees:</b> All full-time, part-time, and temporary staff members who require access to the organization's information resources.</li>
                    <li><b>Contractors:</b>External personnel engaged by the organization who need access to systems and data for performing their contractual duties.</li>
                    <li><b>Third-Party Users:</b>Any external entities, such as partners or service providers, who require access to the organization’s information systems.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>It is the responsibility of all users to comply with this policy and for managers to enforce access controls as per the guidelines. The IT department is responsible for implementing and maintaining access control mechanisms.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Users:</b> All individuals with access to the organization’s information systems are responsible for adhering to this policy. They must ensure that their access is used appropriately and report any security incidents or policy violations.</li>
                    <li><b>Managers:</b>Managers are responsible for enforcing the access control measures outlined in this policy. They must ensure that their teams comply with the policy guidelines and manage access rights based on job requirements and role changes</li>
                    <li><b>IT-Department</b>The IT department is tasked with implementing and maintaining access control mechanisms. This includes configuring and managing authentication systems, conducting regular reviews of access rights, and addressing any issues related to access controls.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Policy Statements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Least Privilege Principle:</b>Access to information systems must be restricted based on the principle of least privilege, which means users should only be granted access rights necessary for their specific job functions. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.</li>
                    <li><b>Authentication Requirements:</b>Users must authenticate their identities using strong passwords or other secure methods. The policy mandates the use of robust authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) where applicable, to ensure that only authorized users can gain access.</li>
                    <li><b>Periodic Review:</b>Access rights must be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they remain appropriate and current. This review process helps to identify and adjust access rights based on changes in user roles, employment status, or other relevant factors.</li>
                </ul>
